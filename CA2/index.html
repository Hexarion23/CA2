          In the aftermath of World War II, as the world moved away from
          traditional, entrepot trade towards industrialization, the importance
          of technical education became apparent to many individuals within the
          government and the private sector. In 1951, businessmen met at the
          Adelphi Hotel in order to discuss the possibility of a polytechnic
          based in Singapore in order to train skilled, local workers.

          The following year, Mr Thio Chan Bee petitioned the government for a
          polytechnic, a suggestion that was accepted. In 1954, the government
          passed the Singapore Ordinance, which led to the official
          establishment of SP, Singapore's first polytechnic. Four years later,
          in 1958, 2800 students registered for 58 courses and the campus was
          completed. A few months later in 1959, Prince Philip officially opened
          SP and Dr Toh Chin Chye took over chairmanship of Board of Governors.

        The 60s represented a decade of growth and restructuring for SP. Being
        the first polytechnic, SP needed to be efficient and notable in order to
        maintain its necessity. The first Graduation Ceremony on 26 August 1961
        was held at Victoria Theatre. In 1963, craft courses transferred to
        Singapore Vocational Institute to make way for expansion and upgrading
        of professional and technician courses and Mr A R Edis was appointed
        Principal.

        Through 1964 to 1968, Dr C A Hart led Colombo Plan team to study
        development of advanced courses. University of Singapore looked into
        feasibility of a faculty of technology and granting university degrees
        to Polytechnic graduates. Professional diploma courses gradually
        replaced by degree courses and the first batch of degree graduates
        produced. A decision was taken to transfer degree courses to University
        of Singapore, giving rise to the Faculties of Architecture and
        Engineering. In 1968 and 1969, Singapore Polytechnic was restructured
        into School of Industrial Technology and School of Nautical Studies and
        Industrial and Business Orientation Programme was launched by Dr Toh
        Chin Chye, Minister for Science and Technology.

          For SP, the 70s represented a time of great growth and development. In
          1971, Nautical Studies, Civil Engineering and Building students were
          housed in Princess Mary Barracks and the campus site at Dover Road was
          chosen as permanent home of the Polytechnic. By the end of 1971,
          Princess Mary Barracks at Dover Road was converted into Princess Mary
          Campus - SP’s second campus. From 1972 to 1979, extensive expansion
          and construction continued. Ayer Rajah Road was campus completed and
          SP began functioning on three campuses.

          Chye on 12 April 1975 and Mr Low Guan Onn was appointed Chairman of
          the Board of Governors. In 1978, the Dover Road campus was completed
          and Mr Khoo Kay Chai confirmed first local Principal after two years
          in acting capacity. Dover Road campus officially opened by Prime
          Minister Lee Kuan Yew on 7 July 1979. The ceremony was held at the
          Quadrangle between the Admin Building and the Library.

        The 80s represented a period of steady growth and expansion, as well as
        some restructuring. In 1980, Singapore Polytechnic (Amendment) Act was
        passed in Parliament on 26 February, reconstituting the Board of
        Governors and reorganising student bodies. Mr Chua Chor Teck was
        appointed Chairman of the Board of Governors the same year. In 1982,
        Five-year Expansion Plan (1982-86) was approved, detailing new targets
        for student enrolment and staffing, as well as new courses. Two years
        later, all full-time Technician Diploma courses were restructured and
        revised to cater for high technology needs.

        Japan-Singapore Institute of Software Technology (JSIST) was transferred
        to Singapore Polytechnic. The following year, Graduates' Guild's

          The 90s represented ten years of quick growth and the establishment of
          many organisations for post-graduation. It represented a decade of
          milestones. In 1990, the new $3.3 million Sports Complex was completed
          and the 50,000th graduate received his diploma at the 30th Graduation
          Ceremony. In 1991, the Dual Training Scheme for workers to study
          part-time at the Polytechnic and receive on-the-job training at their
          companies was introduced and SP became the first poly to offer a
          professional Diploma in Accountancy.

        In 2006, Singapore Polytechnic was awarded the Best Environmental Report
        for 2005 by the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants. In 2007,
        The SP Scholarship Programme was launched with the first batch of 40 SP
        Scholars receiving their scholarships. Mr Tan Hang Cheong took over as
        the new Principal at the start of 2008. In 2009, Chua Koon Ting became
        the first polytechnic student to read Dentistry at the National
        University of Singapore and Kuriakin made history by becoming the first
        student to score distinctions for all his subjects.

          The 2010s represented a decade of new opportunities and growth for SP.
          In 2011, Singapore Polytechnic received the President’s Social Service
          Award 2011 for the voluntary contributions made to the social service
          sector. The following year, a new Board of Board Governors was
          appointed. Outgoing chairman Mr Tan Kay Yong, who dedicated 12 years
          of distinguished service, was replaced by Mr Bill Chang. Six new
          members also came on board. In 2013, SP was awarded the Public Service
          Milestone Award at that year's Excellence in Public Service Awards.

          In 2014, SP celebrated its 60th anniversary and SP’s new vision – A
          caring community of inspired learners committed to serve with mastery
          was announced. The following year, SP reached a key milestone with
          graduation of close to 5,900 students. In 2016, Mr Soh Wai Wah took
          over as the new Principal and CEO in October 2016. Two years later in
          2018, SP achieved its 200,000th graduate milestone.

        I can't really describe the 2020s like I did the other decade, owing to
        the fact that we're still halfway through. However, I can write about
        the milestones that we've had over the past few years. In 2020, Ms Janet
        Ang appointed as the new chairman on 16 September. 3 years later, SP
        launched the first decarbonisation playbook, paving the way for the
        Institute of Higher Learning. The following year, this year, SP
        celebrates its 70th anniversary.

        In 2024, SP achieved the culmination of their efforts: my matriculation.
        HAHA just kidding. There isn't a lot to write about so I'm just gonna
        write down what SP means to me specifically. SP wasn't my dream school.
        In fact, I never wanted to go to a polytechnic in the first place.
        However, due to some circumstances, I had to. I chose SP, and enrolled
        into DIT soon after. To be honest, I was not expecting much of this
        school. Regardless, it blew me out of the water. Here, over the past few
        months, I've learned so much. I've grown as a person. I've found mentors
        and friends with whom I'm so excited to spend my next three years with.
        SP gave me another home. Thank you, SP.
